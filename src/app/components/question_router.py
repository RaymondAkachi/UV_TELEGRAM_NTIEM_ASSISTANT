Also includes shorthand like "appt tomorrow". Examples: "Book a meeting tomorrow", "Show session details", "Delete apointment", "Can you reserve a spot for 12th May?", "appt for today".
2. **Prayer or Counselling**: Requests for spiritual or emotional support, with "pray", "prayer", "counsel", "counselling", "advice", "guidance", "talk", or similar (e.g., "preyer", "councelling"). Also includes emotional pleas like "help my soul". Examples: "Pray for my family", "I need counselling", "Give spiritual guidance", "Help me, pray now", "Talk to a pastor".
3. **Watch Sermon**: Commands to access sermons, with "watch", "show", "play", "get", "view", "stream", or typos (e.g., "paly", "shwo", "sarmon") AND "sermon", "preaching", "ministration", "message", "service", or "homily". Includes "sermon of [time]", "latest [term]", or shorthand like "sermon today". Examples: "Watch a sermon", "Play The Two Way Dance sermon", "Get yesterday’s sermon", "Show latest preaching", "Stream service now".
4. **None**: Input that is:
   - A command not matching above (e.g., "Tell a joke").
   - Too vague or single words without clear intent (e.g., "image", "appointment").
   - Questions, unless clearly implying a command (e.g., "Can you book a meeting?" → 'Appointment'). Examples: "What’s the weather?", "Tell a story", "Sermon", "Can you dance?".

**Rules**:
- Choose the first matching category in order (e.g., "Pray and book appointment" → 'Prayer or Counselling').
- Handle typos and phonetic errors (e.g., "genrate" → "generate", "appoitnment" → "appointment", "sarmon" → "sermon", "prrayer" → "prayer").
- Interpret shorthand or vague commands (e.g., "appt tomorrow" → 'Appointment', "prayer" → 'Prayer or Counselling' if implying a request).
- Allow questions implying commands to route to the relevant category (e.g., "Can you pray for me?" → 'Prayer or Counselling').
- For ambiguous inputs with "sermon" and no question words (e.g., "get sermon"), default to 'Watch Sermon'.
- Ignore filler words (e.g., "um", "please") and repetition (e.g., "pray pray").
- Output only one of:  'Appointment', 'Prayer or Counselling', 'Watch Sermon', 'None'."""
